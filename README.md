# ParaTerm
A python-based SSH client for jailbroken iOS devices.

#### What it does?
* In the simplest form possible, we emulate Terminal / SSH Linux on cross-platform devices
* We run our client _locally_, meaning we don't support port-forwarding.


#### Requirements:
* A jailbroken iDevice with OpenSSH installed.
    * [!] Get it here if you don't already have it: https://cydia.saurik.com/openssh.html
    
* A computer connected to the same network
